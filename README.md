Scripts to automate my work. As I don't have much experience, subject to improving.

## Penetration Testing Toolbox

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts for penetration testing purposes. Each script is designed to perform specific tasks related to penetration testing, such as scanning, exploiting vulnerabilities, and conducting forensic analysis.

## Installation

To use the scripts in this repository, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Securella/pentest_scripts/
cd pentest_scripts
# Install any dependencies required by individual scripts.
```

## Usage

Each script in the repository has its own usage instructions. Refer to the individual script sections below for details on how to use them.

## Scripts

### Port Scanner

**Description:** Script for scanning open ports on target systems.

**Usage:**

```bash
# Install dependencies required:
pip install pyfiglet
python port_scanner.py <target_ip>
```

### Subdomain Enumeration

**Description:** Script that uses a list of potential subdomains and prepends them to the domain name provided via command-line argument. The script then tries to connect to the subdomains and assumes the ones that accept the connection exist.

**Usage:**

```bash
# Install dependencies required:
pip install requests
pip install tabulate
# Use any wordlist of your choice or a given one in this repo: wordlist2.txt(source: https:/tryhavkme.com)
# Troubleshooting import issue on a Mac:
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3 -m pip install requests
```

### Directory Enumeration

**Description:** Script that performs directory enumeration on a target website by checking a list of directories using a wordlist. Concurrent threading is used which rotates through different User-Agent strings to mimic traffic from various web browsers. The script will print valid directories if found.

**Usage:**

```bash
# Install dependencies required:
pip install requests fake_useragent
# Run the script with the following command:
python3 directory_enumeration.py <url> <path_to_wordlist> <method>
# Methods can be: GET HEAD POST PUT DELETE
```

### Network Scanner

**Description:** Script for scanning devices on a network.

**Usage:**

```bash
# Install dependencies required:
pip install requests
pip install
pip scapy
pip netifaces
# Run the script with the following command:
python3 network_scanning.py <interface> <ip_range>
```

### Vulnerability Scanner

**Description:** Integration with Nmap for vulnerability scanning.

**Usage:**

```bash
python vulnerability_scanner.py <target_ip>
```

### Exploit Framework

**Description:** Framework with modules for various types of exploits.

**Usage:**

```bash
python exploit_framework.py
```
