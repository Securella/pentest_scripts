Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/Securella/pentest_scripts/

cd pentest_scripts

Install any dependencies required by individual scripts.

Usage

Each script in the repository has its own usage instructions. Refer to the individual script sections below for details on how to use them.

# Scripts

Port Scanner

Description: Script for scanning open ports on target systems.

Usage:

python port_scanner.py <target_ip>


Subdomain Enumeration

Description: script will use a list of potential subdomains and prepends them to the domain name provided via CML argument.
The script then tries to connect to the subdomains and assumes the ones that accept the connection exist.

Usage:

Install dependencies required: ´pip install requests´, 'pip install tabulate'
Use any wordlist of your choice or a given one in this repo: wordlist2.txt(source: https:/tryhavkme.com)
Troubleshooting import issue on a Mac: insert in Terminal ´/opt/homebrew/bin/python3 -m pip install requests´

Directory Enumeration

Description: script performs directory enumeration on a target website by checking a list of directories using a wordlist. 
Concurrent threading is used which rotates through different User-Agent strings to mimic traffic from various web browsers.
Script will print valid directories if found.

Usage: Install dependencies required: ´pip install requests´, ´pip install fake_useragent´
Run the script with the following command: ´python3 directory_enumeration.py <url> <path_to_wordlist>´

Vulnerability Scanner

Description: Integration with Nmap for vulnerability scanning.

Usage:

python vulnerability_scanner.py <target_ip>


Exploit Framework

Description: Framework with modules for various types of exploits.

python exploit_framework.py
